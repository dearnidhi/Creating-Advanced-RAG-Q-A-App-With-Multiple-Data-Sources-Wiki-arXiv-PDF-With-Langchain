# Creating-Advanced-RAG-Q-A-App-With-Multiple-Data-Sources-Wiki-arXiv-PDF-With-Langchain
It will teach viewers how to create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Q&amp;A app using LangChain, incorporating data from various sources like Wikipedia, arXiv, and PDF documents. It's concise, informative, and should attract the attention of viewers interested in learning about building advanced Q&amp;A applications using LangChain.

Run code by command :- streamlit run QnA.py

Functionality:

This application builds a versatile question-answering system that can access and process information from multiple sources:
Wikipedia for factual topics.
Arxiv for scientific publications.
Loaded web documents (in this case, "https://docs.smith.langchain.com/").
It leverages OpenAI's large language model (LLM) to answer user queries in a comprehensive way, potentially combining information from different sources.
Components:

Information Retrieval Tools:
WikipediaQueryRun: Retrieves relevant Wikipedia articles based on user queries.
ArxivQueryRun: Retrieves relevant Arxiv publications based on user queries.
WebBaseLoader: Loads documents from a specified web URL.
RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter: Splits large documents into manageable chunks for processing.
FAISS: Creates a search index for efficient document retrieval based on their embeddings.
OpenAIEmbeddings: Generates vector representations of text for document similarity search.
retriever_tool: A custom tool to search the loaded web documents using the FAISS index.
Agent and Executor:
ChatOpenAI: Interacts with the OpenAI GPT-3 LLM model.
Agent: Combines the information retrieval tools and LLM model into a single entity.
AgentExecutor: Executes the agent, retrieving information and using the LLM to answer user queries.
Streamlit Integration:

Streamlit is used to create a user-friendly interface:
Displays a title ("RAG Q&A App").
Provides a text input field for users to enter their questions.
Shows the response generated by the LLM agent, potentially combining information from various sources.
Overall Workflow:

User Input: The user enters a question in the Streamlit text input field.
Information Retrieval:
The AgentExecutor analyzes the question and selects appropriate tools from the available ones (Wikipedia, Arxiv, or custom document search).
It retrieves relevant snippets or information from those sources.
LLM Processing:
The retrieved information (context) is combined with the user question and passed to the ChatOpenAI LLM model.
Answer Generation:
The LLM leverages its knowledge and the provided context to formulate a comprehensive answer to the user's query.
Response Display:
The Streamlit application displays the answer generated by the LLM model.
Potential Use Cases in Your Documents:

You can mention that this system demonstrates how Langchain can be used to build powerful question-answering applications that access and process information from diverse sources.
It showcases how to integrate various tools (Wikipedia, Arxiv, custom document search) with a large language model for comprehensive information retrieval and response generation.
This approach can be adapted to create custom question-answering systems tailored to specific domains or information needs by incorporating relevant data sources and potentially fine-tuning the LLM model.
